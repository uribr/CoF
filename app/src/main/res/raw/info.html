<h2>About the Co-Occurrence Filter</h2>

<p>Co-occurrence Filter (CoF) is a boundary preserving filter. It is based on the Bilateral Filter (BF) but instead of
    using a Gaussian on the range values to preserve edges
    it relies on a co-occurrence matrix. Pixel values that co-occur frequently in the image (i.e., inside textured regions)
    will have a high weight in the co-occurrence matrix. This,
    in turn, means that such pixel pairs will be averaged and
    hence smoothed, regardless of their intensity differences.
    On the other hand, pixel values that rarely co-occur (i.e.,
    across texture boundaries) will have a low weight in the
    co-occurrence matrix. As a result, they will not be averaged
    and the boundary between them will be preserved. The CoF
    therefore extends the BF to deal with boundaries, not just
    edges. It learns co-occurrences directly from the image.</p>
