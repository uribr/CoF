# Co-Occurrence Filter Android Application
An Android application that implements the Co-Occurrence Filter using the OpenCV library.
The Co-Occurrence Filter (or CoF for short) is a boundary-preserving, textures smoothing, image filter that is based on the bilateral filter. Boundaries are edges that delimits a texture. A texture is a recurring pattern of neighboring pixels in an image.

### Important Notes
* We used OpenCV4Android v3.30. Note that this module is not included in the project and you have to include it in order to keep developing. Otherwise - the project will not compile.
* One must download the OpenCV manager Android app. Notice that as for March 2018 the Google Play Store version is outdated and you must download and install the dated version using the .apk file in the OpenCV4Android SDK (get it on https://opencv.org/releases.html).
