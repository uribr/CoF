CoF Application
A temporary repository until I get around to merging the two (trying to simply push the files from Android Studio just made a mess).
I found this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1425892/how-do-you-merge-two-git-repositories
Because it is not very needed right now to have a single repository I will take care of it at a different time.
